"1" "                    1 [ARCHIE] Previously on Riverdale  My dad was the Black Hood.  He tried to shoot my dad again.  [BETTY] That's impossible, he was here with us.  I rearranged Nick St. Clair's pretty-boy face for him.  And when some hillbilly threatened Mr. Lodge's daughter,  I did the same thing to him, too.  - Andre. - I'll take it from here.  [GUNSHOT]  The fire's started, mi amor. Chaos is good for us.  A new Sheriff's taken over for Keller,  a man I know very well, Michael Minetta.  For all of Mr. Lodge's talk about law and order,  he was nowhere to be seen tonight.  Don't try to get between me and my dad.  That is a battle you will lose.  This is from when I turned the tables on Nick.  His parents gave me a cool million.  I put it in a trust that you won't touch until you're 21.  So you paid the Ghoulies  and Penny to go to war with the Serpents.  How much is this costing you?  'Cause I have a counter offer.  I hand myself over to you tonight and there's no bloodshed tomorrow.  You're a true hero, Jughead.  Let your dying thought be that your sacrifice was for nothing.  [CRYING]  Come back to me, Jug.  We're not done yet, do you hear me?  Our story's not over. It's just beginning.  So you come back to me.  - Okay? - [GROANS]  - Dad? - [GASPS]  [GRUNTS]  Jug.  What did I miss?  What you did brought every Serpent I've ever known out of the woodwork  and you would've been proud of 'em, boy.  It looked like we were gonna win the day, but in the end there were just  just too many Ghoulies.  It was like shooting snakes in a barrel.  Why?  Why did you go?  I wanted to avenge you.  I had an agreement with Hiram Lodge.  There was no stopping the others.  They were churned up about you and Fangs.  Even though Fangs is  He's alive.  Fangs is alive?  [SIGHS]  But I thought  A deputy called you and told you he was dead.  Yeah, that was a lie.  A ploy, you mean.  To goad the Serpents into a fight they couldn't win.  All of riot night was a Hiram Lodge orchestrated mousetrap.  [SIGHS] And the Serpents followed me right into it.  Sunnyside Trailer Park fell,  and while our trailer's still standing, most of them burned.  Jug, after the rumble,  some of the Serpents defected, they  They joined the Ghoulies, others were arrested.  More went into hiding, the rest, they  They left town.  The Serpents,  they don't exist anymore.  We had our time.  Nothing for you to do but to get better.  And to be there for Betty.  Betty?  What happened with Betty?  [SOFTLY] I'm so sorry that I wasn't there for you,  to help with your dad.  No, Jug.  I never want to see him again.  Right now, all I care about is you,  and taking care of my mom.  And figuring out how to  atone for all of the horrible things my father did.  So I guess we won't be running for student council anymore, huh?  Probably not.  [JUGHEAD EXHALES]  [VERONICA] Here's your schedule for the next three days, Mr. Andrews.  My mom's doing an Eva Peron-like rainbow tour.  Shaking the trees one last time before election night.  I took the liberty of booking you right behind her,  so that people know they have a choice.  Well, I I appreciate that, Veronica, for what it's worth, but  Everybody's already saying that your  parents saved Riverdale after the riot,  that it was their guy, Minetta, who put out the fires  and rounded up the guilty parties.  We know the truth, Dad,  that Mr. Lodge doesn't want to save the town, he wants to take it over.  Luckily, I won't rest until you're elected mayor, Mr. Andrews.  Even if it means I have to put my own political missions aside.  In what respect?  I'm no longer running for student council with Archie.  Conspiring against my parents is proving to be a full-time job.  [CELL PHONE RINGING]  Hey, Eddie, any news?  I'll be out of here first thing tomorrow.  That's good, Jug.  Because we still need your brain.  There's another mystery to solve.  Mr. Cooper was at the town hall  when some other Black Hood took shots at the candidates.  And he was at home with Betty and Mrs. Cooper  when another Black Hood,  probably the same as the one at the town hall,  came after me and my dad. So  Well, a second Black Hood's attacks  at the town hall and on your dad  seem to indicate a political motive.  Which to me suggests  That my father's behind them?  I don't n'sagree.  With Fred out of the way,  my mother's path to victory is that much more assured.  So, if we're gonna stop Hiram, we've got to do it now.  Once the Lodges are in control of the mayor's office, they'll be untouchable.  Yeah, but do you think Hiram would really put on a black hood  and start shooting at people for a mayorship?  No. But he would hire someone to do it.  We were thinking it could be a Serpent, Jug.  Or a Ghoulie.  Or, even more insidiously,  the man that Hiram put in charge of restoring peace and harmony.  - Sheriff Minetta. - He was supposedly  guarding the town hall, but no one saw him.  And he was MIA most of the riot night.  - Let's start there. - Will do.  I have to go down to the sheriff's station tomorrow anyway.  Why, Arch?  I have to identify your dad, Betty.  And with that, it's official.  Congratulations.  With Nana Blossom as my legal guardian,  and I as her youthful ward,  Mummy and Uncle Claudius' stranglehold  on my life and happiness has at last ended.  I will file the papers  and send this letter of separation to your mother.  Oh. No need. She and my odious uncle are still on the estate,  living in one of the barns. I'll happily deliver this missive in person.  [INDISTINCT CHATTER]  First things first  [GASPS]  [BREATHING HEAVILY]  [SIGHS]  [ALICE] Yeah, that's right! He lived here,  the Black Hood! Come closer, do you want to come in?  Do you want to see where he planned all of his murders?  - Do you want to see where he ate, where he slept? - Get out of here! Go!  - The front door is wide open! - [BETTY] Go home!  - Turn off your cameras. Go home. - [ALICE] Come closer!  [BETTY] Hey! Leave us alone.  - Do you want to come see the Black Hood's lair? - Go! Go home!  Abandon all hope ye who enter here.   You know, I don't have to go back to school today, I could come over.  I'm not sure my mom's up for company, Jug.  At least not until the lookie-loos move on.  I'm worried about you.  I know.  Me too.  My mom and I  We'll just have to get through it, and we will.  Okay.  But if you need anything  I'll call you.  I love you.  I love you, too.  [SIGHS]  Ready to do this?  We're set here.  Archie, can you identify the man sitting at that table?  That's Hal Cooper,  my neighbor.  The man who shot my dad at Pop's diner.  He's one  of the Black Hoods.  A lot of people took advantage of riot night.  We had multiple reports of looters wearing black ski masks.  The man at my house wasn't a looter, Sheriff,  he was there to murder my father.  You may not be taking this seriously  but I am.  I'm not gonna let this go.  Make sure your boss knows that.  [FRED] What can I do for you, Betty?  I just wanted to say I'm sorry, Mr. Andrews.  You have nothing to apologize for, Betty.  You didn't do anything wrong.  I'm supposed to be this  great detective,  but I didn't see what was right in front of me.  And people paid for that mistake with their lives.  [MOOSE CRYING]  Moose, you okay?  All of her stuff is gone.  - Whose stuff? - Midge's locker was trashed in the riot.  And [SNIFFLES] All the notes people left her,  and her books, and her stuffed animals,  it's all gone. [SNIFFLES]  It's just things, okay?  You're gonna be okay, Moose.  What do you mean you're withdrawing from the race?  It's clear.  Reggie Mantle is not ready to be a leader of men.  And my mom and I had a big talk after the riots, and  I am an artist, not a politician.  I need to get back to what I'm best at.  Music.  And then there was one.  Well, don't forget about Ethel Muggs,  who's running as a third-party candidate.  [JUGHEAD] So this is how it ends, huh?  Not with a whimper, but with a memo from Weatherbee.  Riverdale High is now suddenly overcrowded.  So, starting next week, all former Southside High students  will be bussed to Seaside High,  - which is two hours away. - Meaning,  he blames us for trashing the school during riot night.  Well, to be fair, Sweet Pea,  you did.  [SIGHING]  What's our play, Jones?  Do we have one?  I don't know anymore, guys.  I can't keep fighting for a gang that doesn't exist.  Well, what about us?  Or any of the other Serpents at the Wyrm?  What Serpents at the Wyrm?  [CHERYL] Buenos dias, Veronica.  I thought you'd wanna know  I saw your strapping, conquistador father  holding a summit with Mummy and Uncle Claudius  at one of Thornhill's barns of all places.  It looked like collusion to me.  [VERONICA] Daddykins, care to comment  on the rumors that you've been having secret meetings  with Claudius and Penelope Blossom in their barn?  Certainly. I'm looking to diversify Lodge Industries' holdings  by possibly getting into the maple trade.  [VERONICA] I see.  So, it's not that you enlisted Claudius to impersonate the Black Hood  and take potshots at Mom during the town hall debate?  Veronica, have you lost your mind?  Your imagination is getting the better of you, Veronica.  Maybe.  Maybe not.  But I don't think any of us in this room  can deny that it's not at least possible  that you'd put Mom in the crosshairs  to pursue some personal political agenda.  I don't understand.  You saw what the Ghoulies did to most of Sunnyside.  A lot of Serpents couldn't afford to leave Riverdale.  So we came here.  Does my dad know about this?  [ARCHIE] You should come back to school,  - be with us. - No, how can I, you guys?  You can't carry this weight on your own.  Veronica is right, Betty.  My dad killed Midge,  he shot Moose.  How am I supposed to show my face there again?  Do you hate him  for what he did to your dad?  Because I do.  I hate my father.  Since when are you drinking again, Dad?  Oh, I am celebrating the fact that I'm no longer Hiram Lodge's busboy.  He fired me from Pop's today. He's cleaning house.  Getting rid of the stragglers.  - Well, he's a bastard. - Yeah.  Who cares? We have work to do.  Why'd you lie to me?  You told me the Serpents don't exist.  They're at the Whyte Wyrm and they need our help.  No, what they need is to cut bait,  get out while they still can.  Now, I wasn't lying when I said that it was over, Jug.  Well, it is time, boy.  What are you talking about?  It is time to skip town.  I'm not going anywhere.  You bet your ass you are.  Toledo.  I already told your mom.  No, I'm not leaving Betty.  We are not abandoning the Serpents.  I will not be standing over a body bag with you zipped up in it.  We're moving to Toledo.  But pack light,  we're only taking the bikes.  Do you think we have a shot, Mrs. McCoy?  Elections are won and lost in these two days.  In my opinion, Fred,  your key to victory is the Southside vote.  Historically, Southsiders don't vote because they feel marginalized.  But if you can get them to the booths,  they'll be voting for you and not Hermione.  Sorry to interrupt, uh, Sheriff Minetta is on the phone,  says it's urgent.  After your visit, Archie, I made it my personal mission  to catch the man who invaded your home.  An anonymous tip  led to the suspect, and when we went to question him  Well, unfortunately, he engaged us in a firefight,  and we were forced to take him down.  He's dead, but he's the guy, no question.  How can you be so sure?  We found guns on the premises that matched the ones  used at both the attack on your house and the town hall shooting,  as well as this black hood.  Who was he?  Ex-gang member, Gerald Petite.  Also known as Tall Boy.  What do you mean you haven't gone to visit Dad yet?  We're taking things one step at a time, Polly.  But if we don't go visit him, how are we supposed to be able to forgive him?  What the hell are you talking about?  Betty, at the farm they taught us  that forgiveness is the most valuable gift we can give.  If we don't absolve him, we'll become what he was,  full of hate.  And my babies deserve a mother who's better than that.  [ALICE] Maybe Polly's right.  I mean, not about forgiving him, but about seeing him.  No.  Maybe that way,  we can get some answers or I can give him a piece of my mind.  If that's what you want, Mom.  But you two can count me out.  [HERMIONE] You were right, Veronica.  It's conceivable  that your father was behind the attack at town hall.  And it made me think  that we, or at least you, should have a contingency in place.  There is a bit of leverage  that, should you acquire it, would give you power over your father.  That's music to my ears, Mom.  Your father's plans for the Southside go far beyond the prison.  He wants to consolidate the entire area into  something.  But there's one critical piece of the Southside that he doesn't own yet,  that's keeping his takeover from being complete.  Though, he's in the middle of negotiations with the proprietor.  What's the name of the spot?  The Whyte Wyrm.  You'll need money to block him, of course.  But that should be easy enough to get.  Daddy, Attorney McCoy  is representing me in regards to that million dollars you plundered from me.  My client would like it back.  That money's in a trust.  I'm looking out for her future.  Of course. And I'm looking out for yours.  The election's in two days and you still want Mom to win, right?  Well, if you don't release my funds,  I'll start telling your secrets, Daddy.  The fake Black Hood attacks, Papa Poutine's murder,  the crippling of Nick St. Clair.  And I won't stop  until all your dirty laundry is exposed.  Or, of course, you could simply give my client what's rightfully hers.  [JUGHEAD] Of course it's Tall Boy.  I'm such an idiot.  You think what Minetta said is true?  That Tall Boy was the second Black Hood?  He's done Hiram's dirty work before.  He confessed to it, which, now that I think about it,  explains why he died suddenly in a firefight.  There's no loose ends.  He can't implicate Hiram, ever.  And now Sheriff Minetta  can say the case of the copycat Black Hood is closed.  Hiram is gonna get away with it.  [SIGHS DEEPLY]  He's gonna get away with all of it.  Nana Rose, Cheryl?  You really think that  that senile crone would be a better guardian than your own mother?  Oh, Mumsy.  Enough.  I'm off to deliver some nibbles to ma cherie  and her chums at the Whyte Wyrm.  Cheryl, no!  You can't go there.  Not tonight.  And why, pray tell, not?  And on top of everything else, my dad,  who's drinking again, wants us to move to Toledo.  Just in time, too.  'Cause Weatherbee wants to kick all the Southsiders out of Riverdale High.  - [ARCHIE] Cheryl? - [CHERYL] Zip it and listen.  We have to get to the Whyte Wyrm ASAP.  I've already called Toni to give her the heads-up.  - What's going on? - My mumsy warned me  that Hiram Lodge's cyborg Sheriff is raiding your precious bar tonight.  And if things turn violent and some Serpents end up shot,  well, so much the better.  Let's go.  Take only what you absolutely need,  and what you can carry with you.  We need to move quickly and quietly.  Sheriff Minetta's forces are all over the Southside  and they're looking for our blood.  If we want our skulls to remain uncracked,  we have to go undetected.  Go where? There's nowhere safe.  We've been offered asylum on the Northside.  [SIRENS BLARING]  Come on, Jug.  Don't look back.  A good boy.  All right. Two dots and a dash.  Two chicks on a raft here, Jug.  And there's a stack of Vermont hot for ya.  Oh, yeah, I worked at Pop's for a summer. Come on.  What's going on here?  You do all this?  With an assist from Archie.  Toledo's gonna have to wait.  Maybe so.  Bulldogs helping Serpents,  Freddie Andrews opening his house to a bunch of snakes.  There goes the rest of your Northside boat, buddy.  We're all neighbors here.  All right. Bacon!  Hey. Thank you.  You came through for me.  I'm not done yet.  How many of these Serpent jackets do you think we can borrow?  [SCHOOL BELL RINGS]  Please have this faxed to the superintendent.  What's the meaning of this?  It's a show of support, sir.  For the Southsiders who are being  wrongly transferred out of our school.  Everyone's ready to walk out, Principal Weatherbee.  Any student who walks out  better keep walking, because they'll be expelled.  You're a good man, Principal Weatherbee.  You're not the kind of person who discriminates.  And if you are, then expel me.  Because I don't want to be a part of that.  Everyone,  get to class.  That jacket looks good on you.  Everything looks good on me.  Well, maybe we should make it official.  Jughead, come here.  I have insider information  that my father is making a play to buy the Whyte Wyrm.  Along with him firing my dad from Pop's.  What?  - He did that? - Yeah.  I won't be eating there anymore.  Wait, Jughead.  I was gonna make a play to buy the Wyrm  in order to torpedo Daddy's monopolizing of the Southside,  but now I'm thinking there's a better, smarter play here.  If you trust me, and we move fast.  [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING]  [HIRAM] Hello. Hog Eye?  [VERONICA] Daddy.  Welcome to the bar I bought from Mr. Hoggins two hours ago.  Here's the deed,  looked over by my attorney, Sierra McCoy.  All legal, of course.  But I'm willing to sell the Whyte Wyrm to you.  Or, rather, trade it.  In exchange for Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.  How did you even know I was after the Wyrm?  [SCOFFS]  It was the hot gossip amongst all the Serpents  who escaped to Fred Andrews' house  the night of your misbegotten raid.  You're risking war with me over Pop's?  - Why? - Because I realized,  once I learned how you so callously fired Mr. Jones,  that Pop's is one of the only places left in this town  that my friends and I can call our own.  [SIGHS]  I'm looking for an even trade here.  You want to barter?  [GRUNTS]  Let's barter.  But to be clear, if I make this deal with you, that's it.  That's the last thing you'll ever get from me.  No more allowance, no more trust fund, no more credit cards.  You'll also sign over your third of Lodge Industries to me.  You'll relinquish your vote,  your seat on the board,  your legacy.  Fine.  That's all blood money anyway.  Jug  Do you think evil can be passed on?  Betty.  My great-grandfather had it,  my grandfather, my father, they were all  murderers, Jug.  - That's just circumstance. - Is it?  Or is it possible that this baby  is gonna grow up to be a monster like my father?  Or like me.  That's easy.  No.  That baby is not evil.  And neither are you.  What if it's my  My destiny, my birthright?  Something I'll never be able to control or understand?  Hey.  Look at me.  I know you.  [SIGHS]  You're a good person, Betty.  You might have some darkness,  just like me  But you're not evil.  Do you believe that?  Do you believe me?  Yeah.  [CHATTER]  Think you'll eke it out, Arch?  Uh, to be honest, Jug, mine's not the election I'm worried about.  In the meantime,  Betty is voting for you through me,  by proxy.  How's she doing?  You know [SIGHS]  I think she's gonna be okay.  I told myself I wasn't going to see you again.  Really?  I never doubted for a moment you'd come.  You're the only one who understands me,  that's like me.  You did  unspeakable,  horrible things.  I'm not like that.  I am not like you.  Aren't you?  No.  Then why are you here?  To say goodbye, Dad.  And also to say  No more darkness,  no more evil.  It's over.  You have no power over me.  You'll be back, Betty.  You can move across the country, you can change the locks!  You can fry me in the electric chair,  but I will always be with you, Betty [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]  [WEATHERBEE OVER PA] Attention, Riverdale High students.  The results of your student council election are in.  Your new student body president is  Archie Andrews.  [ALL CHEERING]  [WEATHERBEE OVER PA] In unrelated news,  for the foreseeable future,  all former Southside High students will remain at Riverdale High.  That is all.  [ALL CHEERING]  [ALL WHOOPING]  [INAUDIBLE]  [FP WHISTLES]  Listen up now!  Hey, listen up!  Some 60 years ago,  the very first Serpent meeting took place  on these same riverbanks. And it makes sense  that is where we gather now, where I  Where I say my goodbye. Jughead, would you step up here, son?  Dad, what are you doing?  What I should've done a long time ago.  I'm retiring from the Serpents.  - For real this time. - [ALL GROAN]  Whoa.  But my boy  My boy has never stopped fighting for this crew.  Hell, he almost died for it.  That's why I'm giving you the mantle.  [ALL CHEERING]  And now, as your first official duty as Serpent King  I think you know what to do with this.  Take it.  [ALL CHEERING]  All right. All right.  All I can say is  I love you, Dad.  And the Serpents will not die out.  Not on my watch.  [CHEERING CONTINUES]  I wanted to let you know, Mom  I went to see Dad today.  How did it go?  To be honest, it was  hard.  But I I think, tomorrow,  I want to go back to school if you think you'll be okay.  [PHONE RINGING]  [FRED] Hello?  Well, um  I appreciate it.  Thanks.  Hermione won.  I'm sorry, Dad.  [KNOCK AT DOOR]  Dad.  Hello, Fred.  May I come in?  [FRED] Was it close, at least?  Very.  Less than 200 votes.  So, what, you came to gloat?  No, Sierra.  I came to tell Fred that he ran a great campaign.  [ALL APPLAUD]  Hey, where did you say your dad was again, tonight?  [HIRAM] Veronica?  Hermione?  They're at my house, Mr. Lodge.  Archie, what are you  How did you get in here?  The door to the servant's quarters  that Veronica keeps unlocked for me.  Oh.  Well, I'll have to see about getting those locks changed.  Oh, congratulations, Mr. Lodge.  You won  everything you wanted.  The Wyrm, the election, the Southside,  the town.  Oh, what do you have there, Archie?  After my dad was shot, I felt lost, powerless.  And you took advantage of that,  manipulated me.  [SCOFFS]  I know about Tall Boy, Mr. Lodge.  That you hired him  to go after my dad,  the same way you got Andre to kill Papa Poutine,  and that boy at Shadow Lake.  What was his name, Cassidy something?  I practically saw that murder.  And Penny.  And the Ghoulies who almost killed Jughead at your bidding.  Archie  These delusions of yours  [ARCHIE SCOFFS]  You're smart, Mr. Lodge.  So, all or any of this will be hard to prove.  But I will.  Wherever you go,  whatever you do,  I'm gonna be there,  watching.  And when I do prove this,  I'm just gonna come for you.  And I won't hesitate like I did with the Black Hood.  I'm gonna make my bones once and for all!  [VERONICA] Well, here's a fun fact about my newest acquisition.  According to Pop Tate,  the basement of this very diner used to be a secret speakeasy,  back in the days of flapper dresses and cigarette girls.  So  Yes?  I want to reopen that speakeasy.  A cabaret space for world-class entertainment  and the most decadent cocktails.  A place for North and Southsiders alike.  In fact, Jughead, I was hoping your dad might want to manage it.  To make sure the Serpents feel welcome and at home.  That's amazing, Vee.  What about your dad?  Knowing Daddy,  he's probably plotting some sort of revenge.  [JUGHEAD] And though, Veronica said it as a half-joke, in fact  That's exactly what her father was doing.  [HIRAM] Ladies, gentlemen,  it's been months in the making, but we're finally here.  Welcome to New Southside.  Where's your wife, Hiram?  Now that she's Mayor, there are certain machinations she can't be privy to.  But the plan remains the same.  The prison will soon be up and operational,  with your drugs running through it, Claudius.  Like brother, like brother. [SIGHS]  Malachai and his Ghoulies will be our soldiers and dealers,  with Ms. Peabody troubleshooting.  And hopefully, doing a better job than she did of killing Jughead Jones.  He wasn't breathing when we left him.  You promised me a brothel, Hiram.  All in good time, Madam Blossom.  What about your daughter and her meddlesome friends?  Not a concern.  Steps have been taken  to dissolve the very glue that holds them together.  I'm proud of you, Mom  for going to visit Dad.  I know that wasn't easy on you.  We all have our albatrosses, Polly.  I think I have someone who can help you, Mom.  A friend of mine from the farm,  who healed me when I was so  broken, after Jason.  If you're open to it,  I would love to invite him to come visit and talk to you.  That sounds nice, Polly.  [BETTY] What made you decide to book this room, Jug?  Not that I'm complaining, mind you.  I don't know.  Felt like after everything that happened that night at the Five Seasons,  might be something you'd enjoy.  I actually wanted to ask you something.  Now that I am the Serpent King  [CHUCKLES]  I was wondering how you felt about being my queen.  Are you asking me to join the Serpents, Jug?  Sort of.  Jug.  You don't have to answer right now.  You can take your time. Let me know.  Like, tomorrow at lunch, or  [LAUGHS]  [JUGHEAD] It was a foolish question  asked between two young people in love.  But it didn't matter, for it would soon be overshadowed  by the next day's cataclysmic events.  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]  Students,  faculty and staff,  before we inaugurate Archie Andrews as our new student council president,  please rise for our national anthem.  Oh, say   Can you see   By the dawn's early light   What so proudly we hailed   At the twilight's last gleaming   Whose broad stripes And bright stars   [DOOR OPENS]  Through the perilous fight   -  Or the ramparts We watched  - [INDISTINCT MURMURS]  Were so gallantly streaming   Sheriff Minetta, what are you doing?  Archie Andrews, you're under arrest for the murder  of Shadow Lake resident, Cassidy Bullick.  What?  - I didn't kill him - You have the right to remain silent.  Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law.  You have the right to an attorney [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]  [MOUTHS] What?      "
